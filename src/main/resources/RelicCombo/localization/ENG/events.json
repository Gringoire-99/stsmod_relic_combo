      "As you step deeper into the Spire, the atmosphere around you becomes increasingly #y~unusual~ , with each step feeling like entering a different realm. NL Time and space seem to blur into a single existence. NL NL You feel that #y~the~ #y~world~ is #y~no~ #y~longer~ #y~indifferent~ , but is #g@responding@ to your every thought in the ~subtlest~ of ways. NL NL An ancient and indescribable #rpower seems to be responding to your will, as if this #yworld is quietly beginning to #p~yield~ to you.",
      "Every time your mind stirs, a hidden #p@law@ quietly takes effect. NL NL This feeling of #g~control~ is #g~intoxicating~ . NL NL Yet you sense that a #r~price~ is approaching, and that with every #r~choice~ , this power becomes increasingly #r@uncontrollable@ .",
      "A mere touch of your consciousness causes these #ppower to start ~gathering~ , start @dancing@ @wildly@ , and begin to respond obediently to your innermost desires, waiting for you to give them #g@new@ #g@forms@ . NL The power of the Spire transforming into #g~something~ #g~you~ #g~need~ . NL However, you also notice your #rlife force being drained by this power, and with every #r@breath@ you take , a part of your #r@essence@ is being drawn away.",
      "A pure desire for #r@destruction@ emerges in your mind, yearning to obliterate all that exists. NL With a mere thought, the #g~certain~ #g~presence~ within you silently begins to #r~collapse~ . NL In the moment of dissipation, a surge of #g@energy@ #g@erupts@ , bringing you into sync with the rhythm of this world.",
      "Your #r@heartbeat@ gradually aligns with the #r@rhythm@ of the Spire, as if #p~certain~ #p~parts~ of the #p~Spire~ have become part of your body. NL Through this resonance, you can #g@reshape@ the existing elements of this world, even beyond their #g@original@ #g@forms@ . NL But at the same time, you become acutely aware that this deep connection is greedily #r@devouring@ your essence, #r@draining@ your #r@most@ #r@precious@ core as a price.",
      "You close your eyes, feeling the flow of #r@power@ around you, as if the #y~entire~ #y~world~ is awaiting #y~your~ #y~command~ . NL NL Yet, you do not take the next step. NL NL You allow this wondrous sensation to gradually #b~fade~ away, ~like~ the #b~silence~ left behind after the #b~tide~ has receded. NL NL You understand that everything is within your grasp, but sometimes, #y~letting~ #y~go~ #y~of~ #y~control~ is the hardest choice."
